# PowerBI-Loading-transformed-data

PowerBI exercises were perfomed online in Skillable Labs.
In this lab we completed the following in the Power Query Editor window:
1. rename queries
2. selecting columns ('choose columns'in 'manage columns' group), then 'go to columns')
3. sorting and filtering columns
4. renaming, merging and removing columns
5. using 'Applied steps'
6. expanding tables by selecting additional columns from a related table
